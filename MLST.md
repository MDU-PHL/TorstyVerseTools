### Software Project Metrics: Impact (optional):

Complete the following for the open source software project listed above. Providing metrics is optional and metrics can be approximate. For each metric, please provide a source, clarify how the metric was computed, and/or provide any other comments. For monthly metrics, please provide data from the most recent month for which the corresponding metric is available.

1. Complete the following table. List the number and explanation for each, if needed:

|                   | Number  | Comment |
| :--               | :--     | :--     |
| Scholarly paper(s) (including preprints) citing or mentioning the software project |  |  |
| Monthly users, if applicable (based on one or more of the following: monthly downloads from websites, monthly downloads from package managers, monthly unique requests for updates, etc.) |  |  |
| Software projects that depend on the project (if applicable) |  |  |
| Monthly visitors to project’s website, discussion forum (e.g. Stack Overflow), or similar |  |  |


2. Size of the largest potential user base:

|                   | Number  | Comment |
| :--               | :--     | :--     |
| Estimate the potential number of unique users who could adopt this project in the relevant field/discipline. Use as guidance the number of users of comparable projects, the number of papers published in the domain to which the project is applicable, number of labs able to adopt the project, etc. |  |  |

3. List of upstream, downstream, or related software projects that the team is contributing to or receiving contributions from:

 - [`any2fasta`](https://github.com/tseemann/any2fasta)
 - dependencies: @torsten likely catches bugs for some of these cats...?
  - [`NCBI BLAST`](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279671/)


4. Additional metrics from project code repositories and package managers:

Provide a short description of any considerations or caveats we should be aware of when computing metrics (e.g. a recent change in the name or hosting of the repository), or any additional information you would like to share about the project’s impact and quality. (maximum of 500 words)
