### Software Project Metrics: Impact (optional):

Complete the following for the open source software project listed above. Providing metrics is optional and metrics can be approximate. For each metric, please provide a source, clarify how the metric was computed, and/or provide any other comments. For monthly metrics, please provide data from the most recent month for which the corresponding metric is available.

1. Complete the following table. List the number and explanation for each, if needed:
