# TorstyVerseTools

Hi everyone...
Torsten and I need help putting together a CZI application to support Torstyverse.
There is a PDF attached with a number of questions I need answers for each of Nullarbor, Snippy, Shovill, Prokka, and MLST.
Any help you can muster, would be greatly appreciated!!
Kristy, I know you are uber busy, so this is just FYI.

A MarkDown (maybe in hackmd?) or Google Doc for each tool with answers to each question would be grand. Perhaps by Wednesday?

Just post here which one you are picking so that there is no duplicated effort, and post a link to the document so we can all help as needed.
